# WeeklyPlanner_Challenge5

# Description

I was given basic HTML and CSS code to create a weekly calender application using jquery and moment APIs. The user will be able to save events at each hour of the day using local storage. The application features past/present/future time-blocking with respective colors to indicate when the user is on the application and what they have done, are doing, and have yet to do in their day.
